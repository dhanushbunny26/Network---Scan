# Network---Scan
# Task 1: Network Reconnaissance

## Objective:
Scan a local network and identify open ports and potential security risks.

## Tools Used:
- Nmap
- Wireshark
- Linux Terminal

## Local Network Scanned:
192.168.224.0/24

## Key Steps:
1. Ran nmap -sS 192.168.224.0/24
2. Captured traffic using Wireshark
3. Analyzed open ports and services
4. Checked for vulnerabilities in exposed services

## Key Learnings:
- Port scanning helps identify surface attack vectors
- Open ports can expose internal services
- Wireshark helps visualize live network behavior
